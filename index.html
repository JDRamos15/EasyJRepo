<h1>Introduction</h1> 

	<p>Even though we are at a peak in technology and computer programming, not everyone knows how to easily develop a program. 
  We understand the different needs from different majors and how they might need to emphasize their attention to something else.
  Syntaxis is the base for writing and understanding any programming language, but some are too complex, even for computer science
  related students and professionals. With this in mind, we take an approach on developing a simplicity-oriented syntax for the Java
  language: EasyJ. Many users of this language express how Java takes an unnecessary amount of lines of code to develop a simple program.
  With this new language we aim to simplify existing Java syntax to reduce the lines it takes to develop a Java program, making it easier
  for anyone to write code in Java, especially non-technical users. We want to minimize the complexity for users when declaring loops, methods,
  among other Java functionalities.</p>

<h2>Language Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Simplicity Oriented</li>
  <li>More readable syntax</li>
  <li>Easy to write syntax</li>
  <li>Reasusable for different functions</li>
  <li>Great for beginner programmers and non-programmers</li>
  <li>Interpretative Language</li>
</ul>  

<h1>Vocabulary</h1>

<h3>Tokens</h3>
<p> A token is a small unit of a language. A token might be a variable or function name (AKA an identifier), an operator or a number.
</p>

<h3>Lexer</h3>
<p> The lexer is supposed to take in a string containing an entire file's worth of source code and spit out a list containing every token. The lexer may do tasks such as removing comments or detecting if something is a number or identifier.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A program that performs lexical analysis may be termed a lexer, tokenizer, or scanner, though scanner is also a term for the first stage of a lexer. </li>
  <li>Flex = A program that generates lexers. Takes a list of regular expressions to specify tokens, and then generates a whole source file (in  C or Java if using Jflex) according to those regular expressions.</li>
</ul>
