Introduction 
	Even though we are at a peak in technology and computer programming, not everyone knows how to easily develop a program. 
  We understand the different needs from different majors and how they might need to emphasize their attention to something else.
  Syntaxis is the base for writing and understanding any programming language, but some are too complex, even for computer science
  related students and professionals. With this in mind, we take an approach on developing a simplicity-oriented syntax for the Java
  language: EasyJ. Many users of this language express how Java takes an unnecessary amount of lines of code to develop a simple program.
  With this new language we aim to simplify existing Java syntax to reduce the lines it takes to develop a Java program, making it easier
  for anyone to write code in Java, especially non-technical users. We want to minimize the complexity for users when declaring loops, methods,
  among other Java functionalities.
